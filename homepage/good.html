                Born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa, I was always fascinated by computers and technology from a young age. As I grew older, I began to realize the vast differences in technological advancement between first world countries and my home country, which sparked my interest in using technology to improve people's lives.
                This passion led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I learned how to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using technology. Through my studies and personal projects, I gained a deep understanding of the power of programming and how it can be used to drive positive change in society.
                After graduating, I plan on dedicating myself to improving the efficiency of people's lives by developing cutting-edge software applications that make a positive impact on peoples lives.
